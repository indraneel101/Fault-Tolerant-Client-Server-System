# Fault-Tolerant-Project
We developed a fault tolerant server system using FUSEPY system and developing N-Modular redundancy where each operation on a
file is replicated into N servers. The system is designed to be robust to single server failures.
Quorum approach of file selection is incorporated in this project. The paper describes the
functionality of data synchronization and consistency among all servers during a serve crash or
file corruption
